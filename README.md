### Motivation

I've studied at different colleges, in different states and countries, and I realized that different people can have very different college experiences, precisely because of the different courses they took, as well as the instructors whom they took them with.

In Singapore (where I studied at the National University of Singapore), underclassmen mostly heed the words and advice of upperclassmen in making decisions about classes to take and when to take them. For courses required for one's major, not much can be done in terms of soliciting advice and opinions, since when had to take them anyway. 

For other courses like upper-level electives, though, the lack of credible and updated sources of opinions, information, and advice seemed more apparent. This problem is made more complex by the fact that only one course offering is offered per course each semester. So students don't exactly get to choose which professor they wish to learn from, anyway. 

In the United States, this problem is different. Students get to "shop" for professors, with sites like [RateMyProfessors](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com), but still face the same problems when looking for opinions and advice on past course offerings.

Students always go on Reddit to seek advice on courses to take, and also read personal reflective course reviews written on other students' blogs. Co-Re aims to aggregate all avenues for course reviews into one platform.
